            <p>Köi is a minimalistic language, mainly aimed at shell scripting.</p>
            <p>It tries to provide a familiar and ergonomic syntax for non-shell code, without compromising the ease of launching and composing programs that traditional shell languages offer.</p>
            <p>Köi is inspired by Rust, Python, JavaScript, Lua and Bash.</p>
            <p>Handcrafted with love and bestemmie using Rust.</p>

<div class="section-header" id="learn-more">Primitive types</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>The <span class="code-inline">nil</span> type (which is also the literal) is used to represent the absence of a value.</p>
    <p>Numbers in Koi have the <span class="code-inline">num</span> type. There's no distinction between integers and floating points. In places where an integer is expected by the language, a check is performed to assert that the decimal part is 0, otherwise an error is thrown.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET primitive_0 --></pre>
    <p>Koi offers 6 different operators for numbers: sum, difference, multiplication, division, power and modulo:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET primitive_1 --></pre>
    <p>Comparison is as usual:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET primitive_2 --></pre>
    <p>Booleans have the <span class="code-inline">bool</span> type. Values are created using the <span class="code-inline">true</span> and <span class="code-inline">false</span> literals.</p>
    <p>Available operators are: conjunction, disjunction and negation:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET primitive_3 --></pre>
    <p>All values in Koi can be coerced to a boolean by calling <span class="code-inline">.bool()</span> on them. All values are truthy expect <span class="code-inline">nil</span> and <span class="code-inline">false</span>.</p>
    <p>Values can be compared for equality using <span class="code-inline">==</span>. Values of different types are never equal:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET primitive_4 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Strings</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>Strings are delimited with either ' or " and can span multiple lines:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET strings_0 --></pre>
    <p>The length of a string can be retrieved using <span class="code-inline">.len()</span>:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET strings_1 --></pre>
    <p>Strings can be interpolated by surrounding expressions with <span class="code-inline">{}</span>. To escape the interpolation, prefix the left brace with a <span class="code-inline">\</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET strings_2 --></pre>
    <p>Apart from <span class="code-inline">\{</span>, other escape sequences are <span class="code-inline">\'</span>, <span class="code-inline">\"</span>, <span class="code-inline">\n</span>, <span class="code-inline">\r</span>, <span class="code-inline">\t</span> and <span class="code-inline">\\</span>. Everything else is left untouched.</p>
    <p>Two strings can be concatenated with <span class="code-inline">+</span>:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET strings_3 --></pre>
    <p>Strings have many different methods to their disposal. Here's a few:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET strings_4 --></pre>
    <p>You can take in input from the user using <span class="code-inline">input('message')</span> just like you would in Python:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET strings_5 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Variables</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>New variables are declared with the <span class="code-inline">let</span> keyword. If you don't provide an initializer, the variable will be <span class="code-inline">nil</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET variables_0 --></pre>
    <p>Koi has blocks and names are lexically scoped.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET variables_1 --></pre>
    <p>Assignment to variables is done using <span class="code-inline">=</span>:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET variables_2 --></pre>
    <p>It can also be combined with many operators:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET variables_3 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Vectors and dictionaries</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>Vectors are list of values of (potentially) different types.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_0 --></pre>
    <p>You can access elements using the traditional <span class="code-inline">[]</span> syntax (vectors are 0-indexed) and retrieve the vector's length using <span class="code-inline">.len()</span>:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_1 --></pre>
    <p>Commas are not required to separate elements most of the time. This will also be true for dictionaries and function calls.</p>
    <p>There are some edge cases were the parser might be too greedy and consume an expression that you intended to be two separate expressions instead. In cases like these, commas can be useful.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_2 --></pre>
    <p>Vectors can be sliced using ranges. Ranges represent an interval between two numbers:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_3 --></pre>
    <p>Also note that an <span class="code-inline">=</span> can appear in ranges after the dots to make it right-inclusive.</p>
    <p>Dictionaries are sets of key-value pairs (also called hash-maps, maps or objects in other languages).</p>
    <p>Keys are internally treated as strings but it's allowed to use numbers and they will be rendered to strings automatically.</p>
    <p>In dictionary literals string keys can appear without quotes.</p>
    <p>Fields are accessed either using the dot-syntax or <span class="code-inline">[]</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_4 --></pre>
    <p>The number of pairs is retrieved with <span class="code-inline">.len()</span>:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_5 --></pre>
    <p>Both vectors and dictionaries act like references to memory but equality is tested by looking at the actual values. This is exactly what happens in JavaScript, Python and alike. You can create a fresh copy of a vector or a dictionary using <span class="code-inline">.clone()</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_6 --></pre>
    <p>Let's take a quick look at the methods that can make working with vectors and dictionaries a little easier:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET vecdict_7 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">JSON</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>Values in Koi can easily be converted to and from JSON strings:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET json_0 --></pre>
    <p>Note that it won't work if the value is composed of non-serializable values (functions and ranges).</p>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Ifs and loops</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>Koi has an if statement and two loops (for and while). They don't require parenthesis to wrap their header but it's mandatory for the body to be a block.</p>
    <p><span class="code-inline">if</span> and <span class="code-inline">while</span> are pretty straightforward:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET ifsloops_0 --></pre>
    <p>The <span class="code-inline">for</span> loop can be used to iterate over: a range, a vector or a dictionary. In the first case it expects one and only one iteration variable, the other two require exactly two: the first is the index or the key, the second is the value. If you don't need either one, name the variable <span class="code-inline">_</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET ifsloops_1 --></pre>
    <p><span class="code-inline">break</span> and <span class="code-inline">continue</span> work as you would expect:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET ifsloops_2 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Functions</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>Functions are declared using the <span class="code-inline">fn</span> keyword. In function calls, commas are optional (just like in vectors and dictionaries literals):</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET fn_0 --></pre>
    <p>We've already looked at a good number of methods: they are essentially functions provided by the language runtime and accessed from values.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET fn_1 --></pre>
    <p>Calling a method actually happens in two steps: first the native function is copied and bound to the value the method was accessed from, then it is called like a regular function.</p>
    <p>This means that methods can be accessed and saved for later. They will remember the object they belong to:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET fn_2 --></pre>
    <p>Lambdas are expressions that evaluate to a new function. They use the same exact syntax as regular functions except they don't have a name.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET fn_3 --></pre>
    <p>Closures are functions that capture the environment they're declared in. They can continue to access this environment even after it falls out of scope.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET fn_4 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Commands</div>

<div class="section">
    <p>Commands like those you would write in a shell prompt are valid statements in Koi. No need to mark or prefix them in any way.</p>
    <p>Code meant to be interpreted and code meant to execute child processes on the operating system can be interleaved freely:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_0 --></pre>
    <p>Command statements, as we shall call them from now on, inherit the interpreter's standard output and standard error. Therefore their output will appear in real time as they're running.</p>
    <p>It might be useful to know how the parser distinguishes what is a command and what is interpretable code: whenever it begins to parse a new line, it looks for keywords that start a statement (such as <span class="code-inline">if</span>, <span class="code-inline">for</span>, <span class="code-inline">let</span>). If it can't find one, then it probes for an expression prefix on the same line. An expression prefix is a series of <span class="code-inline">identifier.</span> until one of <span class="code-inline">[</span>, <span class="code-inline">(</span> or <span class="code-inline">=</span> (or one of its variants) is found. If the parser encounters an error or no prefix is found that matches this pattern, the whole line is parsed as a command.</p>
    <p>Let's look at some examples:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_1 --></pre>
    <p>If a command is also valid interpretable code and is being parsed as such, you can force Koi to parse it as a command by prefixing it with <span class="code-inline">$</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_2 --></pre>
    <p>Now that we're talking about parsing, it might be a good time to explain that Koi has no semicolons at all, not even optional ones. Statements require no syntax to be separated from one another:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_3 --></pre>
    <p>Note that once a line begins with interpretable code, the parser will automatically assume that everything else that follows on the same line is also interpretable code. To force it to parse a command you have to use <span class="code-inline">$</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_4 --></pre>
    <p>Sometimes it might be useful to span a command on multiple lines for clarity. To do that, wrap the command in <span class="code-inline">$()</span> and you won't need to escape every single newline like you would in Bash.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_5 --></pre>
    <p>The same syntax can be used to create command expressions. As the name suggests, they allow you to insert commands where an expression is expected. Evaluating the expression will launch the command, wait for it to finish and resolve to its output that was being captured.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_6 --></pre>
    <p>Commands are parsed like lists of strings with optional quotes. Therefore, command literals inherit all that is available to strings, such as interpolation and escape sequences:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_7 --></pre>
    <p>Arguments are split on spaces that appear outside of quotes or double quotes in the source code.</p>
    <p>We'll demonstrate this using <span class="code-inline">argtest</span>, a little C program that shows us what <span class="code-inline">argv</span> looks like:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_8 --></pre>
    <p>The spaces appear in the source code but inside double quotes. Therefore no splitting is done.</p>
    <p>If we remove them we get many arguments:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_9 --></pre>
    <p>Interpolating a string that includes spaces will not split arguments like it would in Bash. No need to wrap everything in quotes:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_10 --></pre>
    <p>Multiple strings (quoted or not) can appear adjacent to one another and they will  be part of the same argument:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_11 --></pre>
    <p>Remember: splitting is only performed when a space appears unquoted in the source code.</p>
    <p>String interpolation works a little bit differently in commands when compared to strings. If the expression evaluates to an array, a cross product is performed and multiple arguments are produced:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_12 --></pre>
    <p>When Koi starts, all environment variables are declared in the global scope:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_13 --></pre>
    <p>To declare a new exported variable use <span class="code-inline">exp</span>. All variables declared with <span class="code-inline">exp</span> that are in scope of a command statement or expression will be part of the child process' environment:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_14 --></pre>
    <p>Commands can be composed by piping, conditionally chaining or redirecting them.</p>
    <p>Pipes forward the output of a command to the input of the next one. The whole pipeline acts as a single command. You can choose to pipe only standard output <span class="code-inline">|</span>, standard error <span class="code-inline">*|</span> or both <span class="code-inline">&|</span>.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_15 --></pre>
    <p>Chaining is done using <span class="code-inline">&&</span>, <span class="code-inline">||</span> and <span class="code-inline">;</span> and conditionally executes the second command after the first has terminated. The whole chain is treated as a command and the two subcommands' standard streams are joined together.</p>
    <p>Parenthesis can be used to override the default precedence and associativity rules.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_16 --></pre>
    <p><span class="code-inline">&&</span> only executes the second command if the first terminated with a zero return code. <span class="code-inline">||</span> only executes the second command if the first failed. <span class="code-inline">;</span> always executes the second command no matter what.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_17 --></pre>
    <p>Redirection forwards the standard output, standard error or both of a process to a file by overwriting or by appending.</p>
    <p><span class="code-inline">></span> is for overwriting while <span class="code-inline">>></span> is for appending. Both default to forwarding only standard output but their behavior can be changed by prefixing them with <span class="code-inline">*</span> and <span class="code-inline">&</span> just like with pipes.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_18 --></pre>
    <p>Finally, redirection can also be used to forward the contents of a file to the standard input of a process:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmd_19 --></pre>
</div>

<div class="section-header">Command line</div>

<div class="section">
    <p><span class="code-inline">koi</span> takes in the path to a Koi source file to run. Alternatively the <span class="code-inline">-s</span> flag can be set to read the source from standard input.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmdline_0 --></pre>
    <p>The <span class="code-inline">-f</span> argument allows you to specify the name of a function declared in the global scope. Koi will execute the source file and then call the function with no arguments.</p>
    <p>This is useful for writing automation scripts that provide a series of tasks that can be invoked from the terminal. Similar to makefiles or gulpfiles.</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmdline_1 --></pre>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmdline_2 --></pre>
    <p>If no path is provided to <span class="code-inline">koi</span>, a default value of <span class="code-inline">Koifile</span> will be used.</p>
    <p>This means that you can write your automation tasks in a <span class="code-inline">Koifile</span> and run them very easily like:</p>
    <pre class="code"><!-- SNIPPET cmdline_3 --></pre>
